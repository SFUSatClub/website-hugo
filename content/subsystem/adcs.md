The Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) subsystem is responsible for maintaining the orientation of the spacecraft to allow for radio transmissions, maximum power generation via solar panels, detumbling and nadir pointing. Each of these processes are crucial to the success of the mission and encompass a range of technological fields ranging from control systems, electromagnetism and electric machinery. 
To meet the design requirements of this mission the ADCS underlying design is dependent on a combination of Magnetic Torque Rods and Reaction Wheels to control the satellite's orientation. These systems work in partnership with the Attitude Determination system that defines the satellite's orientation in space based off its relative position to the sun. The combination of each of these subsystems as a unit provides the CubeSat with 3 axis attitude control providing the foundation for the satellite to conduct CHIME calibration.
Currently, the ADCS subsystem is working on the following tasks.

* The Magnetic Torque Rod system is currently being modeled in MATLAB and STK using the IGRF magnetic model of Earth to investigate the settling time of the satellite under varying Magnetic Torque Rod parameters and saturation dumping control. 

* The Reaction Wheel Control System has been allocated to a Mechatronic Systems Engineering Capstone group who are simulating and designing a fully functional 3 axis reaction wheel control system. 

* The Attitude Determination system is being modeled in STK and MATLAB to develop the algorithm to determine the satellite's orientation with respect to Earth from raw sun sensor and solar panel data.
