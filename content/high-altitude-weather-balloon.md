Balloon 1, named “Latobius” was a technology demonstration designed to gather experience in creating high-reliablereliability software and hardware designed for harsh environments. 

Launched from Clinton, BC in August 2016, it was an excellent development exercise for the team. As the first of many balloon launches, our balloons in the future will be inexpensive test platforms for satellite hardware and software.
