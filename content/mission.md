The Simon Fraser University Satellite Design Team is collaborating with the [CHIME](http://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/instrumentation/chime/ "CHIME") radio telescope project in investigating the expansion of the universe and the influence of dark energy. We are responsible for designing and building a flight-ready satellite that will be used to calibrate CHIME to facilitate precision measurements. This project is a part of a Canada-wide university competition called the [Canadian Satellite Design Challenge](http://www.csdcms.ca/ "CSDC") where student organizations compete to develop satellites under the guise of industry experts and rigorous testing procedures.
